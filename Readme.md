# Kaiserreich Bug Tracker

Welcome to the Kaiserreich GitHub, it is no longer used for coding, but is now used for bug tracking.

All bugs are welcome here, for KR4, KRDH or the music mod.

As normal with bug reporting, the more detail you give the better and try and avoid duplicate reports.

Thanks for all your help!

- The KR team
