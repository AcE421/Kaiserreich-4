**Quick questions**
HOI4 version: Husky 1.9.1 Beta
Kaiserreich version: 0.11.2

**Describe the change you would like:**

Change is simply adding an agency for Mittelafrika. That is really it.

**Explain the reasoning behind this change:**

Pretty sure some countries do not have an agency logo and name ready but it would be really cool for Mittelafrica
to have its own agency. I already typed a name for it: Zentralafrikanischer Geheimdienst 
(Central African Intelligence Agency). Sounds generic but thats all I got. You guys can make it better though.
I do not know how to make a logo but I got an idea; Palm Trees, Lions/Tigers, the flag of MAF(?). Something that has
a german vibe mixed with an african touch, get it?
